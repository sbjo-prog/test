Getting Started
--------------

The goal of this project is to create a system of actions reactions on mobile and web.  
We built an action-reaction system with webhooks.  
You will have seven services at your disposition, for example Facebook, twitch.  
Each service have some specific actions reactions link to it.  
For example if you sent a message on your Facebook account your account twitter
will post a twit.  
You will be able to link any actions available with any reactions.
